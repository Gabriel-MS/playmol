Playmol
=======

Playmol is just a another software for building molecular models.

Its main distinguishing features are:

* Molecules are created with very simple scripts consisting of a small set of commands.
* Molecular topology arises naturally when atoms are bonded together (angles and dihedrals are automatically detected when bonds are added).
* Multiple copies of a molecule are automatically created when new coordinates are set for their atoms.
* Easy integration with _Packmol_ provides a way of creating complex molecular systems.
* Generation of _LAMMPS_ input data files provides a way of performing efficient molecular dynamics simulations.
