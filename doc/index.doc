<h2>Introduction</h2>

Playmol is just a another software for building molecular models.

Its main distinguishing features are:

@li Molecules are created with very simple scripts consisting of a small set of commands (as described @ref commands "here").
@li Molecular topology arises naturally when atoms are bonded together (angles and dihedrals are automatically detected when new bonds are added).
@li Multiple copies of a molecule are automatically created when new coordinates are set for their atoms.
@li Easy integration with @a Packmol provides a way of creating complex molecular systems.
@li Generation of @a LAMMPS input data files provides a way of performing efficient molecular dynamics simulations.

The sections of this manual are:

@li @ref install "Installation": provides instructions for installing Playmol
@li @ref commands "Commands": provides descriptions of all playmol commands
@li @ref packmol "Integration with Packmol": describes how Playmol can be integrated with Packmol
