Introduction      {#mainpage}
============

Playmol is a(nother) software for building molecular models.

Its main distinguishing features are:

* Molecules are created with simple scripts consisting of a small set of [commands](@ref commands).
* Molecular topology arises naturally when atoms are connected (automatic detection of angles and dihedrals).
* Multiple copies of a molecule are automatically created when new coordinates are defined for their atoms.
* Integration with [Packmol] provides a way of creating complex molecular systems.
* Generation of [LAMMPS] configuration files provides a way of performing efficient MD simulations.

The sections of this manual are:

* [installation](@ref install): provides instructions for installing Playmol
* [commands](@ref commands): provides descriptions of all playmol commands
* [scripts](@ref scripts): provides sample playmol scripts.
