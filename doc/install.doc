/*! @page install Installation

Packages required: git, gfortran (version 4.6 or later), make, and Doxygen.

In Ubuntu 12.04 or later, just type:

@verbatim
sudo apt-get install git gfortran make doxygen
@endverbatim

The source code of Playmol is distributed as a git repository in <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>. To
download it, run:

@verbatim
git clone https://github.com/craabreu/playmol
@endverbatim

This will create a subdirectory named @a playmol in the current directory. The commands for compiling the
source code, generating the documentation, and installing @a Playmol in your system are:

@verbatim
cd playmol
make
make doc
make install
@endverbatim

Once @a Playmol is installed, you can execute a series of input scripts by typing:
@verbatim
playmol <file-1> [<file-2> ...]
@endverbatim

This will execute the specified files, in sequence, as if they were a unique script. If you want to execute the scripts one
at a time, then you will need to run playmol multiple times. 

Another way of executing a playmol script is by making it executable (e.g. via @p chmod @p +x) and starting it with the following line:

@verbatim
#!/usr/local/bin/playmol
@endverbatim
